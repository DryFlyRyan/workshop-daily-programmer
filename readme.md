Choose a challenge folder to begin your Daily Challenge.
Each challenge folder contains a readme with a problem description.

## Tips

 * Try, try, try to do at least one challenge a day.
 * Problem solving is a skill that can be sharpened with dedicated practice.
 * Think ahead! Break down the problem _before_ you write a single line of code.
 * Write out comments in plain english (non programmer terms) that detail what needs to be done to use the given input to create the expected output.
 * After you have broken down the problem, if needed, search the internet for how to do specific tasks, __NOT__ for the solution to the entire problem.

## Contribute solutions

If you come up with a solution that is not yet present in the repo please submit a pull request with your solution added to the solutions folder of the given problem.

The more contributions the better! After coming up with your own solution, its really fun to compare/contrast your solution with the varying coding styles _and_  wide ranges of problem solving styles.

# When submitting a pull request:
* Create a challenge specific branch for your pull request.
 * If you have already committed many solutions locally, "Cherry Pick" the specific challenge commit on a separate branch. How to do that [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256021/send-a-pull-request-on-github-for-only-latest-commit).
* Name the file your name, alias or initials
* Be sure to add a 'created by' comment at the top of the file

## Activate Hard Mode

Challenges getting too easy for you? Try solving the challenge under one of these constraints.


* Solve a challenge with your laptop brightness all the way down.

* Solve a challenge using the shortest number of lines/characters as possible. When submitting a pull request, append the word _golf_ to your file name.
  * This is known as [Code Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)


* Solve a challenge using _only_ [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).


* Solve a challenge in another language.
