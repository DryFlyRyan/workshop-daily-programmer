# Zip Arrays

Implement a function which takes two parameters, both of which are arrays, and zips them together.

ie: The arguments are [1,2,3], and [4,5,6], and after zipping the two arrays, you return [1,4,2,5,3,6].

# Inputs

2 Arrays
```js
zipArrays([1,2,3], [4,5,6]);
```

# Outputs

1 Array - result of zipping the 2 arrays

```sh
[1,4,2,5,3,6]
```
